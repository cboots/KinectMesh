\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Daniel Lee for keeping my eyes to the sky and my feet on the ground as I pursued this project. Special thanks to Dr. Camillo J. Taylor and Dr. Kostas Daniilidis for serving on my thesis committee. \par 
This thesis is powered by CUDA, so I need to thank Patrick Cozzi for teaching it to me. I would never have thought of most of the optimizations or algorithms essential to the success of this project without taking his CIS 565 GPU Programming and Architecture course. On that note, I must also thank Dalton Banks for partnering with me on the first draft of the pipeline code in CIS 565 last semester.\par 
Finally, I doubt I would have made it through the semester with both my sanity intact and thesis complete without the constant support of my friends at the University of Pennsylvania. Thanks to you all.
