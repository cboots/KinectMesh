%This is the segment that can be as long or short as needed to finish in time. Leave to end.
%Performance Analysis. Discuss impact of number of planes, size of planes, etc, with collected data. Highlight areas of improvement, engineering challenges with memory usage, reuse of buffers, reduction of memory usage by parameter tweaking, stream overlapping. Try to benchmark against other algorithms if have time, but probably won't.
