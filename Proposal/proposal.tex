\section*{Problem and Prior Work}
As robots continue to be incorporated into human environments, the need for intelligent and high-speed reasoning about the objects around them increases dramatically. At the simplest level, mobile robots need to create a map of their environment for navigation. At a higher level, some robots need to recognize distinct objects in their environment, track object movement, and have some intuitive sense of object geometry that is easily stored and processed. Even more important is being able to efficiently generate this environment from sensor data in real time. Like the human brain, the robot should also be able to perform these low level functions with only minimal intervention from higher cognitive functions.\\

Previous work has demonstrated the diverse capabilities of depth cameras from generating highly accurate 3D surface models \cite{KinectFusion} to reliable 3D pose estimation \cite{Endres,Taguchi}. However, these efforts have collectively suffured from several limitations
